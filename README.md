# DataVisualizationProject
The objective of this project is to perform an **anlysis of Gun Violence in US** in the past decade. The statistics have as their main purpose discovering trends and correlations between several factors and gun violence.

We have chosen to employ both *Python* and *R* as programming languages, the former being used for data processing and modelling purposes, and the latter for the actual visualization of the data gathered.

Three data sets have been used, the primary one which includes the topic specific information, and two supporting sets that contain the population for each state according to the 2019 census and the state codes.

The data source for the project is Kaggle.
